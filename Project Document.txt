					Description

The Inventory Tracker is a simple application that allows groceries to track available stock of items in their stores. 
A grocery owner will add all available items in their store into the app. 
The owner should be able to update available quantities. The app provides owners with information about all items. 
In addition, the app provides a shopping list report for items that are not available in minimum quantities.

					Development Approach

1. start by implementing the classes
2. complete the Xaml layout
3. bind the Xaml to the class properties 
4. implement button functionality 
5. implement save and open file functionality
6. implement opening new windows to show a general report and shopping list
7. Touch up on minor validation and testing

					Class Design
Completed the class properties first so that I could bind to the Xaml
The rest of the class was finished after I had implemented buttons that needed methods or could benefit from them

					Future Work

I think in the future a feature to download the shopping list as a csv or text file would proove beneficial.
