# Prog3 Final Project
The Inventory Tracker is a simple WPF application that allows groceries to track available stock of items in their stores. 
A grocery owner will add all available items in their store into the app. 
The owner should be able to update available quantities. The app provides owners with information about all items. 
In addition, the app provides a shopping list report for items that are not available in minimum quantities.
